Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023. I use Microsoft Excel to analyze data, some of the knowledge I use include data cleaning, data processing, data analyst, interactive dashboard and drawing insights.
